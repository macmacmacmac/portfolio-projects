# portfolio-projects
Cool and interesting (and presentable) projects for lovely recruiters!

I learn based on experience and experiments. So instead of taking notes in google docs or notion, I tend to just do these projects with some annotations for myself to come back to later. Here are some of said proejcts 

Deep learning stuff!
- **Visualizing neuralnets as crumpled paper.ipynb** People suck at explainning neuralnets. They make it seem like this mystic thing, when all its doing is taking a hyperplane and applying a series of non-linear transformations to it until it fits the shape of whatever point cloud you have...Like crumpling and folding a piece of paper until it fits the data! I try to get that point across with this notebook. 

- **Visualizing how normalizing affects gradients.ipynb** I never properly understood why model convergence improves with better normalized data. So I made a notebook showing how the shapes of the gradient surface varies with different normaization methods!

- **Implementing pytorch sequential from scratc.ipynb** Implementing neural networks from scratch without any reference tutorials using just numpy + I wanted it to be a pytorch-sequential-api-like package as well. Very proud of this one because I did not look up any reference code aside from numpy docs.
